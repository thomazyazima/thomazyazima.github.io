Expectations on DBC Experience
What will it be?

Sep 21, 2014

I watched entire Shereef's Fireside Chat video because I enjoyed the ideas. This was a good confirmation that my personal values and beliefs are pretty much in line with DBC.

Some thougths are so similar that it sounded like I was spoken to my own team. A couple of weeks ago, when I was in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I exposed the following ideas:

- Forget about trying to be better than the other. This is not the issue. Work hard to do it better than you did before, compete against your own self.
- In a software company, the real asset is people. By the end of the day, when the last one leaves the office and turn off the lights, company most valuable asset is gone. You are wrong if you think the value relies on the technology.
- We have plenty of choices and opportunity in life to chose from, if you decide to do something, do it with your head, heart and hands. (learned this from my kids  school - Waldorf education)

I really like the issues covered in the video. From peer collaboration to curriculum design. I am very excited about the potential learnings and the personal growth I will have from this experience.

There is one issue that makes me nervous: verbal communication. Having English as a second language (you may have already noticed by reading this blog) and being an introvert guy, I feel like not being spontaneous enough to express my thoughts. We will see how it goes...

For now, it is time to jump on week 2 on Phase
