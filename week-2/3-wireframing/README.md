# U1.W2: Wireframing

## Learning Competencies
- Explain wireframing
- Identify the benefits of wireframing
- Wireframe a website

## Summary

One of the first steps in creating a web page is to wireframe it. This process should also help you learn to separate different parts of a site (design vs. content, html vs. css, user interface vs. user experience) and learn the process of developing websites.

In this challenge, you'll wireframe how you want your site to look.

While this sounds like it's only a personal challenge, you can pair on building a wireframe, and both use the same wireframe for your respective sites. Or you can both build different wireframes together and discuss the pros and cons of each wireframe. It would be useful to complete the reading prior to pairing.

It's easy to go down a rabbit hole while wireframing, so keep it simple and timebox yourself.

## Releases

## Release 0: Intro to Wireframing

- Read: [A Beginners Guide to Wireframing](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399)
- Read: [Beyond Wireframing: Real Life UX Design Process](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/29/beyond-wireframing-real-life-ux-design-process/)

## Release 1: Wireframe a Blog Template

You'll be writing two blog articles each week in Phase 0 (except for this week), and you'll need to have a blog template to copy and paste so you can easily add your blog content.

Wireframe a blog template. Templates should have space for (at least) a title, date, and text, but you may want to add images or other content as well.

Check out a few blogs to see what information you would want to include in each post if you need some ideas.

You can choose to use a [wireframing tool](http://mashable.com/2010/07/15/wireframing-tools/) or draw it on paper and take a picture of it. Make sure to save an image of your wireframe and name it "wireframe-blog-template." (it can be saved as png, jpg, etc.) If you drew it on paper, take a picture and upload it!

## Release 3: Wireframe your site's index

Now consider how you want the index of your webpage to look. The index is the landing page of your [USERNAME].github.io site, so you'll want it be well thought-out.

You should have a header,footer, and navigation bar on your site.

You will be using this site to promote yourself when you finish Dev Bootcamp, so make sure it has a spot for the following:

  - Links to your social networks (Twitter, facebook, linked-in, quora, github etc. Basically anything from Socrates except for Tumblr, unless you have a tumblr blog you want to add)
  - Your picture
  - Your contact information
  - Link to your blog
  - About me
  - Your projects
  - Anything else you want to include

**PLEASE NOTE:** Don't worry about creating your index page yet. You'll do that later.

Save an image or picture of your wireframe and name it "wireframe-index" as well.


## Release 4: Add your wireframes to your reflection.

Now that you have your wireframes designed and a digital image of each saved, you'll want to display them in your [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file. Use the instructions for adding an image from [2-site-planning](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-unit-1/tree/marias-week2/week-2/2-site-planning) to add both images to your site.


## Release 5: Reflection
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, navigate to the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge and answer the questions by editing the file. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
