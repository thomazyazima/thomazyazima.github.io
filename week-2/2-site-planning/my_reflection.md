## 2. Site Planning Reflection

*Remember, reflections should only take about 10-15 minutes.*

### Site planning

1. What is your site's primary goal or purpose?
2. What kind of content will your site feature?
3. What is the best way to share that content with users?
4. Think about your target audience. What are their interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
5. How do you think most users will find your site?
6. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
