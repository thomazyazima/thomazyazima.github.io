## 4. Beginning HTML Reflection

- What makes sense to you about HTML? What doesn't?
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
- Did you have any "aha" moments where any concepts solidified? What were they?
- Did you have any previous experience with HTML/CSS? If so, how much? If not, how hard did you feel it was to learn?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list them.
