# U1.W2: Blog Template - Mandatory Pairing Challenge!

## Learning Competencies
- Use a wireframe to construct a website
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website
- Position HTML elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins

## Summary
In this challenge, you will be building a blog template using the wireframe you made in the [3-wireframing](../3-wireframing) challenge. You may not use Bootstrap or any other design framework for your site.

This is a mandatory pairing challenge, which means you will need to work on it with a partner. Remember to time box!

## Releases

## Release 0: Wireframe to HTML

In the blog directory on your [USERNAME].github.io site, create a new file called "blog-template.html."

With your partner, compare the two wireframes you made in [3-wireframing](../3-wireframing) challenge. Decide which one you want to use as a reference, or decide to combine the best parts into one.

Using that wireframe as a reference, build your blog template by creating HTML tags for specific content. You may want to add placeholder text like [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com) to the template temporarily to test how the text displays.

Once you have all of the content on your site, you are ready to add CSS.

## Release 1: Apply CSS

In the main directory for your [USERNAME].github.io site, create a "stylesheets" directory. In that directory, create a "blog-stylesheet.css" Link to that stylesheet in your blog-template.html.

Use CSS to position and format the content of your blog. Once you have it displayed as you want it, move on to the next release.

## Release 2: Delete unnecessary text

Since this is a template, you don't want to have unnecessary text you'll have to delete each time, so delete any of the temporary (lorem ipsum, etc.) text. If you want to add comments like ```<!-- insert title here -->``` to make it clear what information goes where, that might be useful.

## Release 3: Modify the Week 1 Blogs

*This part might be easier to do by yourself, but you can continue pairing as well.*

Now that you have an html blog template, you'll want to use it to display your week 1 blogs.

First, create two new files with the same names, but change the file extension from `.md` to `.html`. You should have `t1-git-blog.html` and `c1-chefs-kitchen.html` files.

Copy and paste your "blog-template" html into those files.

Add the content from your markdown files to your new html files.

Delete the markdown files when you have all of the information transferred.

## Release 4: Commit your changes

Now that you've made your template, you're ready to use it in the blog assignments. Add your changes to the stage, commit, and push them.

Now go to [USERNAME].github.io/blog/t1-git-blog.html and [USERNAME].github.io/blog/c1-chefs-kitchen.html. Are your files displaying as you expected them to? If not, can you find out what the issue is?

## Release 5: Reflect
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
