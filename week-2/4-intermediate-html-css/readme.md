# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML & CSS

## Learning Competencies
- Identify and use web standards, semantic mark up, and HTML5
- Build a webpage using HTML5
- Describe what a reset.css file does

## Summary

Most people think of the web websites as mostly static--they look the way they look.  But it's more complicated than that.  Web designers and developers spend a lot of time thinking about how to make web pages usable across all browsers and devices (phones, tablets, desktops, etc.) while keeping them maintainable (i.e. not taking a billion years to make small changes). The WC3, an organization in charge of developing standards for the web, makes changes to HTML and CSS every few years, so they think about how the language itself makes web development easier or harder. You should start thinking about these things too.

## Release 0: Research

Do some research into standard practices of web design, Reset CSS, Normalize CSS, and HTML5. Use the links below *and* look for resources on the web. If you find any good ones, share them with your cohort in the Google+ community!

- w3schools: [HTML5 Introduction](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp)
- Read: [HTML5 and the document outlining algorithm](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/16/html5-and-the-document-outlining-algorithm/)


## Release 1: Apply
Download these [practice files](http://girldevelopit.github.io/gdi-core-intermediate-html-css/class1.zip). Unzip the folder into this (4-intermediate-html-css) directory. Do the following exercises using the files in the "practice" folder. After you are done, compare your work with the files in the "completed" folder. 

- Add reset.css to your index.html file. What happens?
- Update the header links to jump to sections
- Make links change color on hover
- Change the font (@fontface) for elements on the site.
- Change some elements to semantic HTML5 elements (i.e. header, section, etc)

## Release 2: Reflect
Answer the above questions in your [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file.

## Release 3: Commit and push your changes!
Make sure you can see all of your changes on your github.io site!
