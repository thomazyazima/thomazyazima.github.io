# U1.W2: Your Website (Solo Challenge)

**THIS IS YOUR SOLO CHALLENGE FOR WEEK 2.** Please reference the [Phase 0 Handbook](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/) for more details as to what this entails.

## Learning Competencies
- Use the 6 Phases of Web Design to build a website
- Use wireframes to construct a website
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website
- Position HTML elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins
- Use CSS to add and format colors, fonts, icons, images, etc.

## Summary

In this challenge, you will make your [USERNAME].github.io site using the principles of design, site map, wireframe, and HTML and CSS you've learned this far. You may not use Bootstrap or any other design framework for your site.

Get creative. Have fun. But be conscious of time. This site will be a work in progress, so you should timebox how much time you want to spend on each part. You will be able to make improvements each week or unit if you dedicate the time to it. Make an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this version. Designing and building a site can take a **LONG TIME**, so just get your site "good enough" for your MVP. You can always make it better later!


## Releases

## Release 0: Wireframes
Reconsider the wireframe you created for your index.html in [3-wireframing](../3-wireframing). Do you need to make any changes to it based on what you've learned so far?

While you're at it, you should also make basic wireframes for each of the other pages on your site including, but not limited to pages for:
 - About me
 - Projects
 - blog/index.html
 - Any other page your site needs

## Release 1: Design
Now is the time to consider the colors, fonts, icons/logos, images and overall look and feel of your site. You may want to use some of the following resources:

- [Web Design Inspiration](http://www.webdesign-inspiration.com/) Check this out if you want ideas!
- [Adobe Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to create a color theme for your site
- [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) to consider fonts
- [Logo Garden](http://www.graphicsprings.com/) to create your own logo

You also may want to complete the bonus challenge, [Make a Mood Board](../12-BONUS-challenges/mood-board), to help you solidfy your design.

## Release 2: Development

#### Add Content using HTML
Using your wireframes and design as references, add content to your index.html (as well as other) pages in your [USERNAME].github.io site using HTML.

You should include links to each social networking site using icons. Make sure to have a header, footer, and navigation bar (as long as they fit into your design).

Once you have all of the content on your index, you are ready to create the other required pages. Make sure the links on your index will actually take you to the other pages on your site! Don't forget to link to week 1's blog posts on your blog-posts index!


#### Apply CSS
Now you can truly begin to appreciate CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Each page can have a similar look if you use the same classes to format them the same.

- Add styling to your header, footer, and navigation bar.
- Style and position the content to match your wireframe.
- Incorporate the colors, fonts, and format the images you've selected for your site

Don't forget about Chrome Devtools for testing out your style changes and figuring out if you are selecting elements correctly.

Reminder: Designing and building a site can take a LONG TIME, so just get your site "good enough" for your MVP. You can always make it better later!

## Release 3: Publish
When you feel ready to publish your new site, add your files to the stage, commit your changes, and push to master. Post your site on Twitter using **#DBCmysite** to ask for feedback from your peers.

## Release 4: Review

Take a look at two of your peers' sites and give them feedback using the issues on their github.io once you're finished. This is a solo challenge, but it's really useful/necessary to give and receive feedback when it comes to design.

## Release 5: Reflect
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

## Release 6: Pseudo-Selectors (Optional)
Want to dig a bit deeper into CSS? Maybe you're curious about using some exciting CSS like `:hover`. Take a look at:
