- Resize the boxes so they are 30% of their original size

<!-- Add the screenshot here -->

- Make the static div go to the bottom and have an absolute positiion (no matter what, it should always be at the bottom of the page - but not in the browser window) Make the footer 100% the width of the screen

<!-- Add the screenshot here -->

- Make the absolute div a header at the top of the page with a fixed position so it's always at the top of the browser window. Make the width 95% of the entire screen and centered

<!-- Add the screenshot here -->

- Move the relative div position to the right so it's like a right sidebar.

<!-- Add the screenshot here -->

- Make a configuration that plays with margin, border, and padding. See if you can find a quick way to explain that to yourself.

<!-- Add the screenshot here -->

- Make a configuration that uses block and inline-block to see what the differences are
