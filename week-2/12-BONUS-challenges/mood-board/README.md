## Learning Competencies
- Evaluate the use mood boards in website design
- Create a mood board

## Summary

Establishing a look and feel for your website is an important part of web design. Too often developers dive into their site with little thought about the color scheme or font choices, only to realize halfway through the project that their choices don't translate well to the site.

This includes, but is not limited to:
Typography - what fonts would you like to use on your website?
Colors - what color scheme would you like to utilize?
Images - what images evoke the feeling you're trying to acheive on your site? What kind of style are they?

That's where a mood board comes in. Mood boards set the tone for your site by drawing inspirational pictures, color schemes, and fonts together. It's a great way to start thinking about design and what visual elements you want to use.
