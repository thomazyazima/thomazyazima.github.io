# U1.W2: Technical Blog

## Learning Competencies
- Compare CSS concepts
- Explain how and when to use CSS concepts

## Summary:
You've spent the week working with HTML and CSS and probably found yourselves frustrated by a few concepts in the process. Hopefully this blog assignment will help you with one of those concepts.

## Release 0: Copy your blog template
In your `blog` directory, create a new HTML file and name it `t2-css-design.html`. Copy the code from your `blog_template.html`.

## Release 1: Select a Topic
Research one of the following topics:

- What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
- What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
- What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?
- What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?

## Release 2: Blog!
Write a blog post that teaches others how and when to use each thing. There is no length requirement, but it should show off the knowledge you gained this week. You should show examples of code and screen shots to help teach others!

**HINT:** Intend your blog for a non-technical audience. Imagine explaining to a non-technical friend, for instance. Try to take a person step-by-step through understanding one of the topics above.

## Release 3: Publish
Now is the time to add your files to your blog/index.html file. You'll need to link the posts from Week 1 as well. So by the end of this week, there should be links to three posts on either a blog/index.html page.

## Release 4: Promote

Now it's time to show off your work and share your knowledge with your cohortmates using Twitter!

Tweet your blog post using the hashtag **#DBCCSS**.

## Release 5: Read

Read at least one post for each topic (except for the one you wrote about). Give the author A.S.K (Actionable, Specific, and Kind) feedback in a tweet!
