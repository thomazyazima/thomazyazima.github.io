# 9. Testing and Maintenance

## Learning Competencies
- Apply testing metrics to determine whether a site is working properly
- Create a process for incorporating feedback

## Summary
Now that your website is live, it's time to make sure your code works! You'll also create a maintenance schedule to incorporate feedback and respond to new needs.

## Releases

## Release 0: Reading Feedback
Once you've got some feedback about your site from your fellow boots, friends, or family, it's time to decide what feedback you want to incorporate and how soon. Remember, you don't have to incorporate everything this week or even during Phase 0! Building a website is a process that requires constant fine-tuning.

## Release 1: Testing your code
It's time to test your code. First, open up your site in the browser and make sure that all your links work and direct to where they should. Go through every single link. It may take a while, but it's important that your links work properly.

Then go through and make sure all of your CSS and HTML is operating like you imagined. For example, if you're using the :hover pseudo-element, make sure that it's manifesting correctly on the page.

## Release 2: Create a Maintenance Schedule

While it's possible to build a website and then never touch it again, that doesn't make for the best site (You saw Berkshire Hathaway's example of that!). It's important that you constantly update your site to reflect new feedback and any new features you want to incorporate.

Design a schedule strictly for website maintenance. Either add it in written form to your [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file or take a picture of it and add it to the file. Include a time limit for how much you will spend each time you work on it. (Then hold yourself to that).

You should try to revisit your site at least once per unit. In Unit 3 you get the chance to make it over for a challenge, so keep that in mind.

As you work with your site, you may find that some weeks you won't spend the entire time you blocked off. That's ok -- as you work more and more on your site, you will fall into a rhythm of maintenance that works for you.

## Release 3: Reflect
Add your reflection to the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file.

## BONUS: Check Your Page Load

Code school has a great chapter on measuring page load and how to fix and identify common issues. Check it out at [Codeschool Devtools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/chapters/5).
