## Summary

Twitter is a magical place where you can connect, learn and be inspired by anyone in the world. It can be a way more social and intelligent “social network” if you choose to use it the right way.

To prepare our students for a bright future in the tech community we want to make sure you know the ins and outs of one of the world’s most popular social networks.

Twitter is an organic way to keep up with news, make friends and learn things that are happening all over the world. Whether you’re following a hashtag for a developer conference like #railsconf or you want to stay in touch with a developer you met at a meetup, Twitter is a “non-creepy” way to stalk people who say and do amazing things.

Now I’m no mind reader, but you may be thinking one of the following things.  “I don’t have time for Twitter” “I don’t care what you ate for breakfast” or “Isn’t Twitter for celebrities and news organizations?”

Continue on through the following lessons to learn the answers to these questions and many more!

## Release 0: Basics
Before we dive into how to use Twitter, we’ll need to go over some basics. The following list of definitions are important for you to begin your Twitter journey.

**tweet** - anything you write on Twitter and send it out for the whole world to see. Tweets (or posts) must contain less than 140 characters and often include links to articles, images or websites for more information.

**handle** - each user on Twitter chooses their own “handle” aka username, which is your unique identifier. Be sure to choose a handle that reflects your personality. You may just have something with your name like @davehoover or you can play on words like one DBC Chicago grad who goes by @tamatojuice.

**stream** - your Twitter homestream contains all the current and past tweets from other users you follow. You don’t have to keep up with “all the tweets” instead spend 5 minutes in the morning, at lunch, and in the evening browsing to see if anything “interesting is happening” or whether there are any articles worth reading.

**followers** - when you share information on twitter only the people who have opted-in to follow you will see this appear in their stream. Keep in mind this information is still publicly searchable, but remember when you’re first starting out, your audience who will “read your tweets” will be very small. Be patient, this will grow over time as you begin to follow, engage and share worthwhile content with others.

**retweet** - a great way to gain followers is by engaging with other people. When you see someone else post something worthwhile, or something that resonates with you, be sure to retweet them to acknowledge their contribution and to share it with your followers. Other users are notified when you retweet content and some may even thank you :)

**hashtag** - this helps to make your tweets searchable and allows other users to find what you're tweeting about and connect with you if your tweets are relative to what they care about.

**lists** - organize who you follow with this amazingly, helpful tool! Lists help you organize who you're following into focused groups. This will help you focus on a particular topic or group of people while scanning Twitter quickly.

Now that you have some of the basics down, let’s make sure you’re engaging and learning from awesome people.

The amount of value you get out of Twitter is directly related to who you decide to follow on Twitter. Who should you follow? Let’s explore that in the next section.


## Release 1: Following and Etiquette
It’s important that you’re intentional about who you follow on Twitter. You are choosing who gets access to your mindshare and you should follow people that feed and fuel your passions.

When you sign up for Twitter they immediately ask you to follow different “categories” of accounts which may or may not be meaningful to you. Don’t be afraid to opt-out of their onboarding experience by just returning to Twitter.com as they provide a somewhat forceful user experience to follow their recommended categories.

The act itself of following another user on Twitter is pretty easy, but creating a manageable list of worthwhile people to follow takes months of work. We recommend following some of these individuals as you begin your development career.

- [@steveklabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik) - Steve Klabnik: Ruby on Rails developer, doing lots of awesome work in the Open Source community.
- [@chriseppstein](https://twitter.com/@chriseppstein) - Chris Eppstein: Ruby developer at LinkedIn, creator of Compass, co-creator of Sass.
- [@rmurphey](https://twitter.com/@rmurphey) - Rebecca Murphey: JS developer extraordinaire. Amazingly accomplished.
- [@ultrasaurus](https://twitter.com/@ultrasaurus) - Sarah Allen: developer, entrepreneur, co-founder of Railsbridge.
- [@pamelafox](https://twitter.com/@pamelafox) - Pamela Fox: front-end engineer at Coursera, leader of Girl Develop It San Francisco.
- [@jasonlong](https://twitter.com/@jasonlong) - Jason Long: Designer at GitHub. He designed this: http://git-scm.com/ as well as various bits of GH UI you use everyday.
- [@russolsen](https://twitter.com/@russolsen) - Russ Olsen: Ruby developer, author of Eloquent Ruby and Design Patterns in Ruby.
- [@fogus](https://twitter.com/@fogus) - Michael Fogus: functional programmer, speaker, author of Joy of Clojure and Functional Javascript. I worked with him on Himera: http://himera.herokuapp.com/index.html
- [@rachelnabors](https://twitter.com/@rachelnabors) - Rachel Nabors: designer/front-end developer, CSS animation wizard.
- [@davehoover](https://twitter.com/@davehoover) - co-founder Dev Bootcamp, author, apprenticeship dude

A few things to note about following people on Twitter. Instead of the act of “mutual friending” Twitter allows for you to follow anyone that has a public profile with no obligation to follow back.

You should always be thinking about who you want to connect with on Twitter. For example, when I was 18 and living in Ohio, I knew I wanted to work in tech in San Francisco. I began to follow prominent VC’s, Entrepreneurs, and Marketers who were based in SF and immediately felt more “in the know” about what was happening out there.

I always recommend “following and unfollowing liberally.” This strategy allows you to collect lots of possible connections for you to learn from, and then unfollowing them at a moments notice when you decide their tweets don’t add value to your life.

This may sound extreme, but after a few months you’ll have curated a great list of friends, peers, and mentors that you have access to.

When Tweeting keep the following things in mind:
- follow others before you should expect to be followed
- retweet articles or tweets you think others would find worthwhile
- share things to not only express yourself, but to connect with others
- answer questions or offer to help your fellow Twitter members
- respond to others when they mention you

Try:

After following some developers, try asking one of them a question or commenting on an article they shared.

If you find a bug in a program, try tweeting it to their companies account to let them know.

Give a shoutout to @devbootcamp if you want our community team to see you’re taking this lesson seriously. Be playful with it :)

## Release 2: 7 ways to do twitter in 10 minutes a day
1. If you have a smartphone, download the app so you can check it a few times a day
2. Over coffee in the morning, read through 10 tweets to see if there any interesting articles to read
3. Share an interesting article you just read and tag someone, cc: @bcroke that you read it
4. Search for the hashtag for the next meetup or conference you are at, follow or connect with some of the other people there
5. Check twitter for articles to read while waiting in line for public transportation
6. Follow some DBC alumni and see what they are up to
7. After reading an incredible blog post search for the author on Twitter by typing into google “Author Name + Twitter” (Twitter’s user search isn’t very accurate)

## Release 3: Reflection
Reflect on your twitter learnings on Twitter! Use the hashtag #DBCtwitter
This reflection should be super short.

You'll be promoting and sharing your blogs using twitter and specialized hashtags. If you haven't yet, it's time to embrace the twitter-verse.
