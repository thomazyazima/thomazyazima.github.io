# U1.W1: Thinking about Time

## Learning Competencies
- Research time management and productivity
- Explain "Time Boxing" and describe how to use it

## Summary
Remote learning is challenging, especially if you prefer to learn with others. In this challenge you will do some research on time management, productivity, and mindfulness so you can design a plan for your learning during Phase 0.

Read/watch a few of the resources below, until you find something that interests you. Once you do, search for more resources on the subject/technique, and browse whatever you find.

Try to push yourself to read outside your comfort zone. Expand your awareness of strategies for time management and productivity. Can you apply any of what you come across to your situation?

## Release 0: Research
Research Time Management, Productivity, and Mindfulness using the following (or other) resources as your starting point. 'Sprawl' by searching for more resources related to the topics below.

Cover as much ground as quickly as you can, getting an idea of the borders around the subject without charting every square inch. You want to understand the scope of this challenge before you dig into a particular sub-set.

It's easy to get carried away with research, so limit yourself to an hour for this challenge.

After you've gotten a glimpse of the lay of the land, go back and spend more time with anything that sounded interesting. You should have a decent idea about what is out there, so now you can explore the areas that really interest you.

## Release 2: Reflect
As mentioned previously, reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. If you aren't much of a writer, but are more of a talker, you can create video reflections. You'll need to include a link to your reflection video when you get your own copy of the curriculum. Because you don't have that yet, you'll need to keep track of your answers to the questions in the [reflection file](my_reflection.md) on your computer or in your notes. Be sure to write them down! You'll be expected to add them to your reflection file in a later challenge. Remember to limit your reflection time to about 10-15 minutes.
