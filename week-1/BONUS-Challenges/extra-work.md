# U1.W1: Extra Work (Optional)

## Summary
If you don't feel like you've gotten enough work this week, here are some ideas and resources that will be beneficial for preparation for next week. Make sure you are confident with the learning competencies in the command line and git this week before working on any material that is unrelated.

## Resources

### Git
- [Code School: Git Real](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real) You will need to get a trial account before you can complete this.
- [Learn Version Control with Git](http://www.git-tower.com/learn/ebook/command-line/appendix/best-practices)

### HTML and CSS
Next week you'll be diving in to HTML and CSS. So it would be a good idea to run through a bit of material on this. NOTE: Some of this material will be included in next week's curriculum.
- [Codecademy: HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
- [HTML and CSS by Jon Duckett](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) This does cost some money.
