# Week 1: Git, Github, and the Command Line

**Welcome to Phase 0!** We hope you are excited to further your knowledge and begin integrating into the developer and DBC community. Please make sure you've completed the [Phase 0 prerequisites](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/phase-0-prerequisites.md) **before** getting started with the weekly challenges.

Please keep track of how much time you spend on the required sections of Phase 0 challenges. We'll ask you for this information in your weekly submission forms to gauge whether we are giving too much, the right amount, or not enough work each week.

When you have questions about the instructions or how to do something, are confused, or need help, please post on the Google+ community. Staff and students will post responses. You should never feel alone during Phase 0. Please reach out to us at <phase0@devbootcamp.com> if you do.

## Submitting your work
- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) to "turn in" your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday be 11:59pm.

**If you do not finish by the deadline:**
- Complete the Unit 1 extension request. (You only get one extension for Unit 1)
- When the work is complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com).


## Remember your Unit Expectations!
- Give feedback for each person you paired with, if any. You need to submit at least 6 pieces of feedback in this unit. (4 for peer pairing, and 2 for GPS)
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. (You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit)
- Sign up for GPS 1.1 and 1.2 on our [scheduling app](https://phase0.devbootcamp.com/login) (These must be done in a session with a guide, and there are only enough sessions for students to attend one, so make sure you sign up early!)
