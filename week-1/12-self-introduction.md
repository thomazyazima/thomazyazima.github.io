# U1.W1: Get to know your cohort

## Learning Competencies
- Describe what you learned from someone else's reflections
- Consider strategies for time management and productivity

## Summary

Despite popular belief, most software engineers work in teams and there is a strong developer community (on the web and locally) for many technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby. It's important to get used to sharing with each other.

## Releases

## Release 0: Read someone else's reflections

Log on to [Socrates](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/) and look at your cohort. Find the person after you in the cohort list. Click on their name. On their profile, you should see their GitHub username. Go to their repository and read their reflections for each challenge. The URL should be https://github.com/[THEIR-USERNAME]/phase-0-unit-1. If it gives you a 404 error, try writing the URL directly. If you still get an error, send them an email and ask how they are doing.

Once you've read them, or while reading through them, consider what you learned by reading another person's reflections. Keep it in mind for your introduction email!

## Release 1: Intro Email

Each cohort has it's own email list visible on the cohort webpage. Email that list with the subject "self introduction" or reply to the main thread you received. In your email, include your:

- Name
- Location
- Why you're attending DBC
- What you are most excited to learn about
- What you learned by reading [NAME]'s reflection
- When the best time for you to pair is
- Links to your 1) orked `phase-0-unit-1` repository and your [USERNAME].github.io site

Send your email!
