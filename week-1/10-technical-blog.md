# U1.W1: Git Bloggin'

## Learning Competencies
- Describe version control
- Explain how git tracks changes
- Evaluate the benefits of using GitHub to store code

## Summary

Each week's curriculum includes a mandatory blogging component. In the tech community, blogging demonstrates a willingness to give back by teaching others. Blogging also requires you to practice researching and synthesizing information, both of which are vital to your growth as a developer.

As you may have guessed from the [Twitter challenge](9-twitter-intro.md), being active on social media and blogging will be important to your future career prospects as well. If a hiring manager is considering two candidates for a position, both of equal in technical knowledge and skill except one candidate actively blogs and tweets, it's likely that candidate will have an advantage over the other who is not active on social media.

That said, no one expects your blog to be mind-blowingly good. You have only been learning this stuff for [insert # of] week(s) after all! The purpose of the blog is to show your growth and willingness to put yourself out there. When you graduate from DBC, one of the phrases you'll use to promote yourself is that you are a fast learner -- so what better way to show it than to give them a link to your blog? We recognize the difficulty of writing about technical concepts you are new to. It's hard! Practice limiting yourself to an hour to hour and a half to research and write each blog post. You don't have to be an expert!

There are many other reasons we have blog assignments. One is that we simply cannot introduce you to enough important technical concepts through challenges! Trust me, the more you research and get acquainted with, the better prepared you will be. Moreover, writing for an audience (i.e. teaching") also requires you to understand the material better by cementing and identifying gaps in your knowledge. Although the blogs may seem like they are taking away time from coding, they will actually prepare you for DBC by introducing you to important concepts that will be discussed later.

## Release 0: Consider
This week you've learned a bit about the command line and gotten more familiar with Git and GitHub. Now it's your turn to write a blog to introduce these concepts to other beginners. Be sure to think about:

- What are the benefits of version control?
- How does git help you keep track of changes?
- Why use GitHub to store your code?

## Release 1: Prepare your blog

**Using ONLY your command line**

- Navigate to your [USERNAME].github.io repository
- Make a directory called `blog`
- In the `blog` directory, add a new file called `t1-git-blog.md`
- Copy the markdown template from [blog-template.md](blog-template.md) (in this repository) into your `t1-git-blog.md` file.
- Add and commit your changes with a good commit message
- Push your changes
- Navigate to your [USERNAME].github.io/blog/t1-git-blog.md

If you went through every step, you should see the blog template live on your site!


## Release 2: Write

Now, in your `t1-git-blog.md` file, write your blog post and address the main questions described above. This will be a post you share with others, so do remember to check it for clarity. You should imagine your audience is a n00b (newbie) to programming. If it helps, imagine writing post on the questions above for yourself last week.


## Release 3: Proofread

Like I said, no one expects your blog to be perfect, but since coding is a precise discipline that relies on proper syntax, it's a good idea to proof-read once.


## Release 4: Publish

Once you are satisfied with what you've written, go through the git workflow to put your blog online. It won't look pretty, since markdown files won't be rendered, but it will be readable.

Next week you will make this post much prettier - but for now it's important that you get the content up there.

Double check you can see your updated content on [USERNAME].github.io/blog/t1-git-blog.md.

## Release 5: Promote

Now that your awesome blog is done, it's time to tweet about it! (This is required by the way). Make sure to practice your awesome tweeting skills to introduce the topic.

Tweet using the hashtag **#DBCgit**.
